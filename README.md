# Oceanography: Predicting Salinity in Water
A Jupyter Notebook where I explore correlations with salinity in water using over 60 years worth of oceanographic data. More info can be found in the Jupyter Notebook.

Make sure to download the dataset from (https://www.kaggle.com/sohier/calcofi) if you want to recreate the Notebook on your machine for whatever reason.
