# Oceanography: Predicting Salinity in Water
A Jupyter Notebook where I explore correlations with salinity in water using over 60 years worth of oceanographic data. More info can be found in the Jupyter Notebook. Throughout the notebook, I conduct exploratory data analysis of the data, look for correlations with different variables, and create a model using linear regression to predict salinity levels based off other factors.

Make sure to download the dataset from (https://www.kaggle.com/sohier/calcofi) if you want to recreate the Notebook on your machine for whatever reason.
